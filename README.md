# netty-mobile-drugvokrug
Back to 2009, beginning of social network for mobile platforms - which should work via bluetooth ID, 
my first working Java experience.

Platform JavaEE, Netty for connections, MySQL - may be few other interesing features.

Well, at least even being alone as a programmer there, i got some new experience.

Can say that http://netty.io wasn't easy for me to start using, 
well kinda another stack - compare at that time with Python Twisted with their deferred conception (ooh.. was tough)

But it was 7 years ago, so welcome to the legacy
